"Sous Vide ""Poached"" Eggs",dessert,"These sous vide eggs have a perfectly set white with a runny yolk.

This sous vide-cauliflower side dish proved to be a great accompaniment. My family fights over who gets to finish it.",,,,
72-Hour Sous Vide Short Ribs,lunch,"Sous vide cooking works its magic on many foods but yields some of the most dramatic results on short ribs. In traditional recipes, the ribs (usually cut into short 2- to 3-inch chunks by the butcher) are braised for several hours. Although the braising method adds great flavor and makes the meat extremely tender, it's also usually well done. But thanks to our sous vide wizardry, we're able to maintain a perfectly pink medium-rare and fork-tender meat. After tasting these short ribs, I may never cook any type of ribs the same way again. This summer, I plan to lightly smoke a rack of spare ribs, then cook them sous vide for a few days before finishing them back on the grill. I expect pretty incredible results.",,,,
Sous Vide Chicken Breast with Lemon and Herbs,dinner,"If you've never had sous vide chicken before, you're about to be amazed by how tender and juicy it is! Feel free to play around with different aromatics.

The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not hot enough to release the bitter, acidic flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee.

Deep-Fried Sous Vide Egg Yolks,dessert,"If sous vide eggs had been invented 2,000 years ago, there would have been entire books of the Bible dedicated to their praise. But at the last meeting of the Jet City Gastrophysics, we took a giant leap forward. You see, the beauty of a sous vide egg lies in its exquisite texture. After about an hour in the water bath, the yolks become buttery with nearly the texture of pudding. The only way to improve on this amazing transformation is to add a crunchy shell. These fried eggs make excellent tapas, particularly if your guests aren't expecting what's inside. Perhaps in another thousand or so years, we'll discover something even more delicious.",,,,
Sous Vide Mashed Potatoes,dinner,"This recipe for basic mashed potatoes uses your sous vide immersion cooker.

Sous Vide Cajun Boneless Chicken Breast with Creamy Pan Sauce,dinner,"Flavorful Cajun seasoning, cream, and Parmesan cheese are the stars in this dish, as is the incredibly juicy chicken that results from cooking sous vide. Traditionally you need to cook chicken to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) or until no longer pink, however with sous vide cooking, you can achieve the same safety with extended cooking time at lower temperatures. Using an ice bath will lower the chicken temperature slightly, so that it does not overcook during the searing step. If you prefer a lot of sauce, double the sauce ingredients.",,,,
Sous Vide Dill Pickles,dinner,"People are always asking me when I'm going to make these dills again. They will last, at least a year. Deliciously crunchy. I'd say this recipe is for about a gallon-sized jar, however, I alter it to accommodate however many fresh pickles or cucumbers I have.",,,,
Sous Vide Flank Steak,dinner,"Sous vide is a cooking method that uses circulating, temperature-controlled water around food enclosed in a leak-proof plastic bag. Over time, the food reaches the same temperature as the water, but since it doesn't come in contact with direct heat, it doesn't dry out, and it's much harder to overcook. This recipe gives instructions for cooking a flank steak with a sous vide circulator, with a quick sear after the water bath. Because the temperature is controlled, you can complete other tasks in the 90 minute cook time.",,,,

Sous Vide Carrots,dinner,"These lightly sweetened and buttery carrots are cooked to perfection using a sous vide immersion cooker. While it does take longer than other methods, the carrot flavor is much more pronounced because you're cooking the carrots in their own juices.

I like to use small carrots, sold in bunches with green tops attached; trim down the greens, and lightly scrub the carrots for a rustic look.",,,,

However, it does not require much attention because the sous vide circulator does all the work for you, except slicing, of course!",,,,

Serve with a good tartar sauce.",,,,

This recipe is great for experimenting with a variety of different vegetables, spices, and kinds of vinegar.",,,,
Scallop and Prosciutto Bites,appetizer,"These prosciutto-wrapped scallops are a different version of bacon-wrapped scallops, a common appetizer. Using prosciutto allows for the subtle flavors of this meat to come through without overpowering the wonderful flavor of the scallops. Additionally, the fat content and grease are significantly less than bacon for health-conscious people. I serve this as an appetizer and people love it. Increase the portion size to serve it as a main course.",,,,
Chilean-Style Sopaipillas,lunch,"This is a traditional Chilean snack, or maybe an appetizer. The truth is that it's a snack eaten during wintertime, especially when it rains. It is typical to arrive home after walking through the rainy streets of Santiago and sit down to have a cup of tea and eat a couple of sopaipillas. You can also eat ones sold by street vendors, but they usually don't taste as good as homemade ones. If you can't find zapallo, pumpkin is a good substitute.",,,,
Seviche,lunch,"This seviche recipe was given to me by a dear friend from Ecuador. This dish is also great with raw shrimp, scallops, or fish.

Deep-Fried Sous Vide Egg Yolks,breakfast,"If sous vide eggs had been invented 2,000 years ago, there would have been entire books of the Bible dedicated to their praise. But at the last meeting of the Jet City Gastrophysics, we took a giant leap forward. You see, the beauty of a sous vide egg lies in its exquisite texture. After about an hour in the water bath, the yolks become buttery with nearly the texture of pudding. The only way to improve on this amazing transformation is to add a crunchy shell. These fried eggs make excellent tapas, particularly if your guests aren't expecting what's inside. Perhaps in another thousand or so years, we'll discover something even more delicious.",,,,

They're both wonderful.",,,,
City Ceviche,dessert,"A wonderful appetizer to enjoy with friends when San Francisco's Indian summer warms the city. The true way to 'cook' the fish is to marinate it in citrus juice overnight, but I find that the poaching process is faster and an easy way to judge if it is indeed cooked. I often buy precooked shrimp (but NOT frozen!) and just poach the scallops. Best when served with cold beer (we prefer Pacifico) and fresh limes. Using quality and sturdy tortilla chips is essential. Please note that the size is meant for appetizer portions.",,,,
Empanadas Fritas de Queso,dinner,"These empanadas use queso chanco, but a good substitute is a mixture of Swiss and Havarti. I usually bake mine, but they are really good fried. I serve these with a chile-Chile sauce.",,,,

Sausage-Stuffed Piquillo Peppers,appetizer,"There's nothing quite like the piquillo pepper. They're sweet, fruity, slightly smoky, and just bitter enough. For me, they're the San Marzano tomatoes of peppers. And while I enjoy them in literally anything, these delicate, triangular beauties are just made for stuffing.",,,,
Citrus Ceviche,appetizer,My take on the classic Peruvian ceviche. The acidity of the citrus fruit 'cooks' the fish. A nice refreshing meal on a hot summer day. It's imperative to use only freshly caught fish!,,,,
Poor Mans Ceviche,appetizer,This is a quick and delicious appetizer/dip dish. I promise most guests will enjoy it. You can add Tapatio hot sauce or cayenne for a more spicy taste.,,,,
