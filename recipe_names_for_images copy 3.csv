Baked Shrimp Scampi,appetizer,"I've probably been making this recipe since I got it from my Mom in about 1985. I have no idea where she got the recipe from. I've been changing it over the years, and now I call it my own. When we started dating back in 1997, my husband would every now and then order shrimp scampi at a restaurant and always regret it afterwards, saying none of them competed with mine. You can vary the amounts of some of the ingredients, like the cayenne and garlic, to suit your taste. That's what I've done here because we like spicy and garlicky. Yum! Serve over angel hair pasta or any pasta of your choosing.",,,,

Animal Style Fries,unknown,"Everyone knows that despite being freshly cut, the pale and soggy fries are In-N-Out's weakest point, but if you smother them in cheese, sweet caramelized onions, and In-N-Out spread, they're magical. So replacing the sad fries with crispy frozen fries really is an improvement over the originals here. Spread is just a basic sweet and tangy burger sauce with mayo, ketchup, relish, a little sugar, and a little vinegar. The onions are really the stars here - soft, sweet, and jammy. Be sure to serve immediately as soon as the fries are cooked - the residual heat of the fries and the onions is what melts the cheese.",,,,

Sous Vide Chicken Thighs,appetizer,"Utilizing the sous vide method to cook chicken thighs makes the most tender and juicy chicken you'll ever have! Using chicken thighs with skin ensures you won't overcook the chicken when seared in the pan. You traditionally need to cook chicken until no longer pink and the meat reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C); however, with sous vide cooking, you can achieve the same safety with extended cooking at a lower temperature.",,,,
Sous Vide Cauliflower,dinner,"With so many great Asian dishes on this site (check out Chef John's caramel chicken, for example), we always look for interesting side dishes to pair with them. This sous vide-cauliflower side dish proved to be a great accompaniment. My family fights over who gets to finish it.",,,,
72-Hour Sous Vide Short Ribs,lunch,"Sous vide cooking works its magic on many foods but yields some of the most dramatic results on short ribs. In traditional recipes, the ribs (usually cut into short 2- to 3-inch chunks by the butcher) are braised for several hours. Although the braising method adds great flavor and makes the meat extremely tender, it's also usually well done. But thanks to our sous vide wizardry, we're able to maintain a perfectly pink medium-rare and fork-tender meat. After tasting these short ribs, I may never cook any type of ribs the same way again. This summer, I plan to lightly smoke a rack of spare ribs, then cook them sous vide for a few days before finishing them back on the grill. I expect pretty incredible results.",,,,
Sous Vide Chicken Breast with Lemon and Herbs,dinner,"If you've never had sous vide chicken before, you're about to be amazed by how tender and juicy it is! Feel free to play around with different aromatics. Traditionally you need to cook chicken to 165 F or until no longer pink, however with sous vide cooking, you can achieve the same safety with extended cooking at lower temperatures. I have experimented and 148 F is my personal preference for texture.",,,,

"Sous Vide ""Cold Brew"" Coffee",dinner,"This method mimics the traditional time-consuming method of making cold-brew coffee in the fridge, but in 2 hours instead of 24! The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not hot enough to release the bitter, acidic flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee. The result is a super smooth brew that you'll want to make again and again. Use your favorite fresh-ground coffee for best results.",,,,
Sous Vide Eye of Round,breakfast,"Sous vide is the best way to cook this affordable beef cut, turning it into the most tender and juicy roast! The long, slow process breaks down connective tissue resulting in a roast that is fork-tender. I serve this with mushroom gravy.",,,,
Deep-Fried Sous Vide Egg Yolks,dessert,"If sous vide eggs had been invented 2,000 years ago, there would have been entire books of the Bible dedicated to their praise. But at the last meeting of the Jet City Gastrophysics, we took a giant leap forward. You see, the beauty of a sous vide egg lies in its exquisite texture. After about an hour in the water bath, the yolks become buttery with nearly the texture of pudding. The only way to improve on this amazing transformation is to add a crunchy shell. These fried eggs make excellent tapas, particularly if your guests aren't expecting what's inside. Perhaps in another thousand or so years, we'll discover something even more delicious.",,,,
Sous Vide Mashed Potatoes,dinner,"This recipe for basic mashed potatoes uses your sous vide immersion cooker.

The added flavor is well worth the time, plus you free up space on the stove for other things!",,,,

Sous Vide Cajun Boneless Chicken Breast with Creamy Pan Sauce,dinner,"Flavorful Cajun seasoning, cream, and Parmesan cheese are the stars in this dish, as is the incredibly juicy chicken that results from cooking sous vide. Traditionally you need to cook chicken to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) or until no longer pink, however with sous vide cooking, you can achieve the same safety with extended cooking time at lower temperatures. Using an ice bath will lower the chicken temperature slightly, so that it does not overcook during the searing step. If you prefer a lot of sauce, double the sauce ingredients.",,,,
Sous Vide Dill Pickles,dinner,"People are always asking me when I'm going to make these dills again. They will last, at least a year. Deliciously crunchy. I'd say this recipe is for about a gallon-sized jar, however, I alter it to accommodate however many fresh pickles or cucumbers I have.",,,,
Sous Vide Flank Steak,dinner,"Sous vide is a cooking method that uses circulating, temperature-controlled water around food enclosed in a leak-proof plastic bag. Over time, the food reaches the same temperature as the water, but since it doesn't come in contact with direct heat, it doesn't dry out, and it's much harder to overcook. This recipe gives instructions for cooking a flank steak with a sous vide circulator, with a quick sear after the water bath. Because the temperature is controlled, you can complete other tasks in the 90 minute cook time.",,,,

While it does take longer than other methods, the carrot flavor is much more pronounced because you're cooking the carrots in their own juices.

I like to use small carrots, sold in bunches with green tops attached; trim down the greens, and lightly scrub the carrots for a rustic look.",,,,

However, it does not require much attention because the sous vide circulator does all the work for you, except slicing, of course!",,,,
