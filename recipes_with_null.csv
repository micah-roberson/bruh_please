Smoked Paprika Goulash for the Slow Cooker,dinner,"This slow cooker Hungarian-style goulash is a very rich and flavorful beef dish with a thick, red and smoky-tasting sauce. Great for making a day ahead and reheating. Instead of noodles, you can serve over rice, or potatoes.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions until they soften and begin to brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a slow cooker. Cover and set cooker to Low heat.
Mix together paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Toss meat cubes in the paprika mixture until evenly coated.
Heat one tablespoon of the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Put a third of the beef cubes into the skillet and cook until nicely browned on all sides. Transfer to the slow cooker. Pour 2 tablespoons of water into the skillet and scrape browned bits from the pan; pour liquid into the slow cooker. This prevents paprika from burning when you brown next batches of beef. Add another tablespoon of oil to the skillet and cook next batch the same way; repeat for third batch.
Stir tomato paste and the rest of water into the slow cooker; cover. Cook on High for 4 to 5 hours (or on Low for 6 to 9 hours).

Matzoh Ball Soup,dinner,"This is one of my favorite soup recipes. I always double the recipe for the matzoh balls, since everyone enjoys them so well.

Some people say that the matzoh balls make the broth a tad cloudy.","Trim off neck flap all the way up to the top of the wishbone. Trim fat and skin from around the back cavity of the chicken. Reserve both for schmaltz and grebenes. Cut chicken into quarters. Place meat in large pot with onions, and cover with about 4 quarts water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat , and simmer 2 hours.
Add carrots and celery to the soup; simmer an additional hour. Season to taste with salt.
Remove chicken pieces, and set aside. You may reserve them for another use, or shred the meat for the soup. Keep the chicken covered, and at room temperature before shredding.
Dice reserved skin and fat into 1 inch pieces. Cook in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally. Make sure the pan never gets so hot as to cause the rendered fat to smoke. When the grebenes are crisp and brown, remove them to a cutting board and drain schmaltz into a small nonplastic bowl to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, mince the grebenes finely.
To make the matzoh balls, blend fat or oil and eggs together. Mix matzoh meal and salt together. Combine the two mixtures, and mix well. Add 4 1/2 tablespoons soup stock or water; mix until uniform. Stir in minced grebenes. Cover bowl, and place in refrigerator for 20 minutes.

Pumpkin Mousse,dessert,"A light airy, alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie. Water can be substituted for milk if you would like a non-dairy mousse.","Pour the 1/2 cup of water or milk into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it to soften.

Combine the milk, honey and spices in a heavy bottomed saucepan and heat until the honey dissolves and the mixture is steaming hot. Add the softened gelatin with its liquid and stir until it is completely dissolved.
Pour most of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, then pour this mixture back into the pot and continue heating until it thickens and almost boils. Stir in the pumpkin and keep stirring until there are no big bubbles when you stop stirring for a few seconds. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.
Beat the egg whites until frothy, then start adding the sugar gradually, beating until stiff peaks have formed. Fold a big spatula of the whites into the pumpkin custard, then fold in the remaining egg whites. Turn the mousse into a 6-cup metal mold that has been rinsed with cold water. Chill mousse overnight. To unmold, dip the mold in hot water for about 30 seconds then invert onto a platter.

Some people say that the matzoh balls make the broth a tad cloudy.","Trim off neck flap all the way up to the top of the wishbone. Trim fat and skin from around the back cavity of the chicken. Reserve both for schmaltz and grebenes. Cut chicken into quarters. Place meat in large pot with onions, and cover with about 4 quarts water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat , and simmer 2 hours.
Add carrots and celery to the soup; simmer an additional hour. Season to taste with salt.
Remove chicken pieces, and set aside. You may reserve them for another use, or shred the meat for the soup. Keep the chicken covered, and at room temperature before shredding.
Dice reserved skin and fat into 1 inch pieces. Cook in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally. Make sure the pan never gets so hot as to cause the rendered fat to smoke. When the grebenes are crisp and brown, remove them to a cutting board and drain schmaltz into a small nonplastic bowl to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, mince the grebenes finely.
To make the matzoh balls, blend fat or oil and eggs together. Mix matzoh meal and salt together. Combine the two mixtures, and mix well. Add 4 1/2 tablespoons soup stock or water; mix until uniform. Stir in minced grebenes. Cover bowl, and place in refrigerator for 20 minutes.

Meringue Cake with Whipped Cream and Raspberries,dessert,"Meringue is not difficult to make, and this fresh-tasting dessert makes them well worth the time involved!","The night before, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees.
Line a lipped cookie sheet (approximately 12 by 18 inches) with parchment paper. Trace two side-by-side rectangles - about 5 inches by 12 or 13 inches - on the paper. Crumple the paper, then smooth it out again and line the bottom of the pan.
Whisk together confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and cornstarch. Set aside.
In the bowl of a mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until they turn from foamy to white and beaters just start to leave a trail. On low speed, add sugar mixture, a heaping tablespoon at a time. Increase speed to medium-high and beat to the consistency of marshmallow cream, 2 to 3 minutes longer.
Just before forming meringues, flick water onto parchment with fingertips. Divide meringue in half, spooning two or three mounds down each traced rectangle. Use a rubber spatula, or a cake decorator's metal offset spatula, to fill in and even out rectangles.
Set meringues in oven, close door and turn oven off (but leave oven light on). Let meringues dry overnight. Remove, then carefully set a wire rack or cookie sheet over meringues. Invert; peel off parchment and turn right side up. (It's OK if edges chip.) Wrap in foil and set aside until ready to proceed.
No more than two hours before, whip cream to soft peaks, beating in remaining sugar and the vanilla. Set one meringue on a platter. Spread with half the cream and sprinkle on half the berries.

Pecan And Chocolate Espresso Pie,dessert,"A delicious nutty, chocolate coffee dessert!","To Make Crust: In a medium bowl, combine flour and salt and mix well. With two knives or a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture is in fine crumbs. Gradually add just enough ice water so that the pastry holds together. Form into a ball, then flatten into a disk. Handle as little as possible. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 to 2 hours.
Roll out crust on lightly floured surface with lightly floured rolling pin. Turn crust over frequently and lightly re-flour work surface and rolling pin as necessary. Crust should be rolled into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Fit crust into an ungreased 9 inch pie plate of heatproof glass; form a high-standing rim, trimming excess from edges and pinching or fluting rim decoratively as desired.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 C). Thoroughly prick crust all over with fork. Chill for at least 10 minutes while oven heats. Bake in preheated oven 5 minutes (crust will not brown). Remove to rack and cool completely before filling.
Leave oven at 400 degrees F (205 C). Break up pecan pieces and sprinkle them evenly on the bottom of the cooled pie shell.
To Make Filling: In a small bowl beat eggs to combine. Add espresso powder and beat to mix. Let stand at least 10 minutes, beating occasionally to dissolve espresso.
In a medium bowl cream softened butter, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat in cocoa and salt. Add egg/espresso mixture 1/3 at a time, beating after each addition, until smooth. Stir in corn syrup. This mixture will be like custard and it will be thick.
Pour mixture slowly over pecans in pie shell. If any pecans do not get completely covered by the filling, submerge them until they do. Let stand 2 to 3 minutes; with toothpick or tip of sharp knife, pierce any remaining air bubbles (during this standing period, pecans may rise to top of pie).
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat from 400 degrees F (205 C) to 350 degrees F (175 C) and bake 33 to 37 minutes longer (or until edges are cracked and risen but pie center still quivers slightly when pie is shaken gently). Do not over-bake! If pie begins to brown excessively, cover top lightly with foil. Remove from oven; cool on rack before.

Chestnuts and marrons glace are available in specialty food stores and gourmet stores.","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a greased 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Then grease the parchment paper.
Separate the eggs.
In a food processor puree the chestnuts with the butter and the rum, scraping down the sides, until the mixture is smooth. Add the melted bittersweet chocolate and blend the mixture until it is combined well. With the motor running, add the yolks, 1 at a time, and transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the whites with the salt until they hold soft peaks, add the sugar, a little at a time, beating, and beat the meringue until it holds stiff peaks.
Whisk about one fourth of the meringue into the chocolate mixture to lighten it and fold in the remaining meringue gently but thoroughly. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
Bake the cake in the middle of a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it and the top is cracked. Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, remove the side of the pan, and invert the cake onto another rack. Remove the bottom of the pan, invert the torte onto a rack, and let it cool completely. (The cake will fall as it cools.)
To Make Glaze: Put 6 ounces of the finely chopped chocolate in a small bowl, in a saucepan bring 1/2 cup of the cream to a boil, and pour it over the chocolate. Stir the mixture until the chocolate is melted and the glaze is smooth and stir in 1 tablespoon of the rum. Dip each candied chestnut halfway into the glaze to coat it partially, transfer the chestnuts to a foil-covered tray, and let them set.
Invert the cake onto a rack set on wax paper, pour the glaze over it, smoothing the glaze with a spatula and letting the excess drip down the side, and let the cake stand for 2 hours, or until the glaze is set. Transfer the cake carefully to a plate and garnish it with the coated chestnuts.
Make the whipped cream just before the cake: In a chilled bowl with chilled beaters beat the 1 cup heavy cream until it holds soft peaks, beat in the 2 tablespoons sugar and the1 tablespoon rum, and beat the mixture until it holds stiff peaks.
