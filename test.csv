Taameya Egyptian Falafel,lunch,"Ta'ameya (Egyptian falafel) is an all-time favorite street food in Egypt. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. In Egypt however, we make it with dried fava beans. These are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.","Place fava beans into large bowl and cover with several inches of water. Let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Combine soaked fava beans, red onion, parsley, cilantro, dill, garlic, coriander, salt, and cumin in a food processor; process to a dough-like consistency.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds; cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate.
Shape fava bean mixture into about 50 balls. Roll balls in sesame seeds to coat.
Fill a large saucepan 1/4 full with oil; heat over medium heat. Fry fava bean balls in batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.","dried split fava beans

Colombian Arepas,lunch,"Colombian arepas made with mozzarella cheese are quick and easy to make with this recipe. They are usually served for breakfast, as a side dish, or even for a quick meal.","Mix water, cornmeal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl.
