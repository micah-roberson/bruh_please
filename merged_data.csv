Although time-consuming, you can fry wrappers in sesame or olive oil for the extra flaky shells, folded in a triangle for about 1 minute on each side.

"Sweet Potato ""Hummus""",appetizer,"This was simply a case of me wanting hummus, not having garbanzo beans, and making it anyway with sweet potatoes. I don't blame you if you're skeptical, but this stuff has the same taste and texture as hummus, just with a slightly sweet finish reminiscent of red pepper hummus. My wife, Michele, who has a much more discerning palate than I do, said that if blindfolded, she'd have trouble distinguishing this from real hummus.",,,,

"Baked ""Fried"" Rice",dinner,"This easy oven method for baked ""fried"" rice produces something very similar to classic fried rice, but you don't need leftover rice to make it.
